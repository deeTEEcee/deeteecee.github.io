Purpose:
- to make some kind of a profile site and see what tools people use to make one
- to see how this kind of a static site is different from a bigger, servicing site

TODO:
- move this to private repository and still be able to host site (option: https://github.com/Glavin001/GitLab-Pages)

- learn what tools are being used (modernizer, etc.)
- add "small description" for what contribution projects are and what projects are
- fix color for my DTC label on the top left
- add something nice-looking roundabout circle or something js-meshed up showing my interests

New posts to add:
I'm doing a weekly "do something development related" since I started work in order to push myself. Just telling me is not enough.
