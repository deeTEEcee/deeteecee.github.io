Purpose:
- to make some kind of a profile site and see what tools people use to make one
- to see how this kind of a static site is different from a bigger, servicing site

TODO:
- learn what tools are being used (modernizer, etc.)
- add "small description" for what contribution projects are and what projects are
- fix color for my DTC label on the top left
- add something nice-looking roundabout circle or something js-meshed up showing my interests
